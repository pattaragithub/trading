# First, we need to import the necessary libraries for our algorithm:
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# Next, we define the parameters for our grid trading algorithm:
# Define the price range for our grid
min_price = 20000
max_price = 200000

# Define the grid's width as a percentage of the price range
grid_width = 0.32

# Define the investment size
investment_size = 10000

# Now, we can calculate the number of grid levels by dividing the price range by the grid width:
# Calculate the number of grid levels
num_levels = int((max_price - min_price) / (grid_width * (max_price - min_price)))

# Next, we create an empty DataFrame to store our grid levels and prices:
# Create an empty DataFrame to store our grid levels and prices
grid = pd.DataFrame(columns=["level", "price"])

# Now, we can loop through the number of grid levels and calculate the price for each level:
# Loop through the number of grid levels
for i in range(num_levels):
    # Calculate the price for the current level
    price = min_price + (i * grid_width * (max_price - min_price))
    
    # Add the level and price to the DataFrame
    grid = grid.append({"level": i, "price": price}, ignore_index=True)

# Finally, we can place our limit orders using the calculated prices:
# Loop through the DataFrame and place limit orders
for index, row in grid.iterrows():
    # Place a limit order at the calculated price
    # The order will remain active until it is filled or cancelled
    order = limit_order(price=row["price"], size=investment_size)
